// NOTE: The live content API is only available in Sanity v4 and next-sanity v10+
// This project currently uses Sanity v3, so this file is disabled.
// To enable live content updates, upgrade to Sanity v4 and next-sanity v10+

// Querying with "sanityFetch" will keep content automatically updated
// Before using it, import and render "<SanityLive />" in your layout, see
// https://github.com/sanity-io/next-sanity#live-content-api for more information.

// For Sanity v3, use the standard client.fetch() method from './client'
